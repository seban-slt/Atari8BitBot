# Atari8BitBot - code examples

This repository contains the code and some simple programs that I posted to the [@Atari8BitBot](https://twitter.com/Atari8BitBot) created by [@Kay Savetz](https://twitter.com/KaySavetz) and [@Bill Kendrick](https://twitter.com/BillKendrick). For more info about the Twitter bot please check the [Atari8BitBot](https://atari8bitbot.com/) website and the bot Twitter profile. Twitter bot can run Atari BASIC, TurboBASIC XL, Logo, PILOT, or Assembly code and I'll run it on an Atari 8bit emulator. The code length is limited to the 288 characters due to Twitter message length limit.

## Why?

When I saw this bot, I was sure that is really great idea. This gives a lot o fun, and the limitation of code length is very challenging and sometime requires strong mind-bending :) Looking at other people code is very didactic and interesting. A lot of great ideas can be found in other people code.

Some people ask me some questions about code, and how my stuff works, so I decided to put all the code here on GitHub, there is no limit for length, so I can put code in more readable form here.

## Greetings

My big greetings must go to the __Kay Savetz__ and __Bill Kendrick__ for creating this bot. This is really great work! Thank You for that!

I want to greet all the people that likes and shares my work. Thank you for your support. Of course I do it mostly for fun, and for re-creating ideas from the past in more compact form! As well by my work I wanted to appreciate the creators of the bot. Also my greetings must go to all people that posting interesting programs for bot.

And of course the greetings must go for all who ask the questions, and want to understand "How it was done?". All of You was very inspirational, thanks to You this repository was created. I have hope that will grow instantly. Writing that simple and short code examples is very relaxing and helps me to free my mind :)
